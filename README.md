The paper presents an application of the Binary Multi-track Sequential Generative Adversarial Network (BinaryMuseGAN) to generate original Scottish music from a reduced dataset of songs by exploiting a Transfer Learning approach. The GAN model is first trained on a larger and diverse music collection, to learn representative features of music in general, and then fine tuned on the smaller dataset of traditional Scottish music.

The work has been completed by the researchers of the Intelligent Computational Engineering Laboratory (ICE Lab) of the Univeristy of Strathclyde during Covid 2020 lockdown.
